hey kilo 
this is my portfolio 
we have to add the Page for the Experience with the timeline like structure and dynamic look with the amazing Animation 

for this check the layout and @/src/App.tsx  and @/src/pages  folder also make necessary components in the @/src/components  folder and take inspiration from the @/src/components/achievements  @/src/pages/Achievements.tsx  so it

design the page in same UI pattern and theme as that of the rest of the app and also make it theme toggle anable with mobile responsive design. 

add necessary data in the @/src/data/ folder
and also make sure to add the route in the @/src/App.tsx  file 

I want the pop up like structure also so the viewres can see the details of the experience with certificate in it like the achievements page
